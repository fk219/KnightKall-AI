# KnightCall AI - Complete SaaS Implementation Guide

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete transformation of KnightCall AI from a demo application into a production-ready SaaS platform for AI-powered calling automation. The solution leverages n8n Cloud for workflow automation, Supabase for database management, and React for the frontend interface.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components
```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
    ‚Üì
n8n Cloud Workflows (Automation Layer)
    ‚Üì
Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)
    ‚Üì
Retell API (AI Voice Calling)
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: n8n Cloud workflows (serverless automation)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
- **AI Voice**: Retell API for voice calling
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify for frontend

## üìä Database Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design
The database is designed with organization-level isolation:
- Each organization has separate data boundaries
- Row-level security (RLS) enforces data isolation
- Scalable pricing tiers based on usage

### Key Tables
1. **organizations** - Multi-tenant support
2. **users** - User management with roles
3. **agents** - AI agent configurations
4. **calls** - Individual call records
5. **batch_calls** - Bulk calling operations
6. **call_analytics** - Detailed call analysis
7. **billing** - Usage tracking and invoicing

## üîÑ n8n Workflows

### 1. Outbound Call Handler (`1-outbound-call-workflow.json`)
**Purpose**: Processes individual dialer calls
**Trigger**: Webhook from frontend dialer
**Flow**:
1. Validate agent exists in Supabase
2. Create call record in database
3. Initiate call via Retell API
4. Update call record with Retell call ID
5. Return success/error response

### 2. Batch Call Processor (`2-batch-call-workflow.json`)
**Purpose**: Handles bulk calling operations
**Trigger**: Webhook from batch call creation
**Flow**:
1. Create batch record in Supabase
2. Split tasks into individual calls
3. Rate-limit calls (5-second intervals)
4. Execute each call via Retell API
5. Update task status and batch progress

### 3. Call Event Handler (`3-call-event-handler.json`)
**Purpose**: Processes real-time call events from Retell
**Trigger**: Retell webhook events
**Flow**:
1. Route by event type (started/ended/analyzed)
2. Update call status in database
3. Store analytics data
4. Update batch task progress
5. Trigger any post-call actions

### 4. Analytics Dashboard (`4-analytics-dashboard.json`)
**Purpose**: Provides real-time analytics data
**Trigger**: Frontend analytics requests
**Flow**:
1. Route by analytics type (daily/weekly/monthly/realtime)
2. Query relevant data from Supabase
3. Process and aggregate metrics
4. Return formatted analytics response
